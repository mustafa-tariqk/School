/**
 * A class that models the state of the puzzle game Dabble.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The game Dabble is made up of five English words of lengths 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
 * (these five words make up a solution for the puzzle). The letters of the all
 * of the words are randomly scrambled together to produce five scrambled puzzle
 * words of lengths 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. For example, the five solution words:
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code it, you, here, batch, burner}
 * 
 * <p>
 * might produce the five scrambled words:
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code un, uei, ytrc, bahrt, obrehe}
 * 
 * <p>
 * A player attempts to unscramble the words by repeatedly exchanging a letter
 * from one scrambled word with the letter in a second scrambled word.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The puzzle is solved when the player has formed five English words of lengths
 * 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (not necessarily the same words as the original solution
 * because there is often multiple solutions).
